                   <h1> The Green Dragon Tavern </h4>
                    <i style = "margin-left:25px;"> The barkeep slides a frothy mug your way as you settle onto a worn wooden stool.</i>
                      <br/>
                    <i style = "margin-left:25px;"> "Welcome in, lad! Plenty o’ food, drink, and tales to go 'round! If you've got a question or a story to tell, just say the word!"</i>
                        <br/>
                     <i style = "margin-left:25px;"> You glance around the room, smoke curling near the rafters, laughter rising from a group of rugged men gathered by the hearth. You nod toward them and raise an eyebrow.
                        The barkeep leans in with a grin. </i>
                          <br/>
                    <i style = "margin-left:25px;"> "Ah, them? Ha! They’re the reason this town still stands. Not your usual lot of adventurers, mind ye. Most come chasin’ coin, glory, or runnin’ from their past. But that crew? They had somethin’ else: fire in their blood and steel in their will. Came when no one else would, and stood their ground when the rest turned tail..."</i>

            <h2 class="mt-4">About us</h1>

                    <p> 
                        RenFaire Games began as many adventures do-not in a boardroom, but around a table scattered with dice, character sheets, and half-finished ideas scribbled in the margins of day jobs. Behind the curtain, we’re four professionals scattered across the United States, fluent in the languages of logistics, code, project flowcharts, and data dashboards. By day, we chase deadlines. By night, we chase dragons.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of us have collaborated for years in the realms of industry and analytics-solving complex problems, crafting elegant systems, and managing chaos with grace. But beneath the spreadsheets and syntax, a different rhythm beats: the call of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, and the shared joy of rolling natural 20s with old friends.
                    </p>
                   
                    <p>

                        What began with a single GURPS sci-fi campaign-an improvised homage to Traveller with duct-taped starships and caffeine-fueled plot twists-quickly evolved into something more. Worldbuilding became ritual. Game nights turned into war councils. And ideas, once flung out in jest over late-night Discord calls, started to demand maps, mechanics, and playtests.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Thus, RenFaire Games was born-not out of a business plan, but a collective impulse to create the kind of tabletop experiences we always wished existed. We craft adventures that blend old-school soul with modern mechanics, modules that honor the legends of the past while daring to chart new realms. From retro-infused sci-fi settings to whimsical, chaotic romps through fantasy realms, our goal is always the same: to spark imagination, forge camaraderie, and remind people why they fell in love with gaming in the first place.
                     </p>
                    
                    <p>
                       We don’t just make games-we build stories you can inhabit, choices you can argue about, and moments your party will talk about for years. RenFaire Games is our forge, our tavern, our launchpad. And if you're the kind of player who enjoys laughing in the face of certain doom, you're in good company.
                    </p>

                 <i style = "margin-left:25px;"> To the left of the hearth, stands a knight, half-shrouded in the orange glow, his armor etched with arcane runes that pulsed faintly in rhythm with the flames. He leans against the wall, arms crossed with a tankard in hand. </i>
                 <br/>
                <i style = "margin-left:25px;"> "That one who looks like a dark army's commander is Skyzorn... He is the party's chief. They may be a team, but every team has its leader... Don't skimp on ordering his drink."</i>

                    <h2 class="mt-3">Woodward Cox: Tactical Dreamweaver & RPG Alchemist</h2>
                    <p> 
                       At the heart of RenFaire Games’ creative forge is Woodward Cox—a builder of worlds, breaker of spreadsheets, and lifelong explorer of the imagination. With a background steeped in detail-driven work like software, storytelling, and data organization, Wood bridges the gap between structure and story with precision and flair.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By day, he’s fluent in facts—nutrition labels, code snippets, application development, PDF parsing, corporate nonsense—and by night, he’s rolling dice, dreaming up adventures, and distilling classic RPG vibes into modern, retro-inspired modules. Whether assembling a crew of sci-fi misfits or engineering mechanics that make players lean in, Wood brings both tactical expertise and whimsical curiosity to every table.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He’s the kind of creator who reads the rulebook and then rewrites it—for fun. At RenFaire Games, he’s helping lead the charge to build immersive, collaborative game experiences that blend creativity, camaraderie, and just the right amount of chaos.
                    </p>

                <br/>
                 <i style = "margin-left:25px;"> Next to Skyzorn sits a dark haired man in leather and chain armor with a large well-groomed moustache. He wears a pair of finely crafted and matching blades, a saber and main-gauche, at his belt and is conversing with an well-dressed man. They appear to be discussing something. </i>
                 <br/>
                <i style = "margin-left:25px;"> "The one with the curved blade on his belt goes by ‘Kas’". He’s never told his real name, but he acts as if he was raised as a nobleman, leading a band of mercenaries known as the Ravens, with his quick tongue and with his even quicker blades..."</i>
                     <h2 class="mt-3">Brian Norquist</h2>
                    <p> 
                        Brian started gaming back in 1978, playing in his middle school’s library in San Diego, CA. D&D blew his mind and created such an amazing spark in his young life. He made incredible friends and memories playing, and many of these friends are still close with him and regularly play games.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Brian played D&D 1st through all the editions, although 3.5 is still his favorite. Brian also played (and still plays) Pathfinder, Traveller (yes, the little black books), GURPS, Gamma World, and several other games. Brian's favorite system is GURPS, and he’s run an all-day game in-person every other week for close to 20 years. Brian mostly run games in Fantasy and Sci-Fi settings, of which he has known for the extensive backgrounds and detailed write ups, and requiring the players to help create backgrounds for their characters. With his extensive DM/GM experience, He has become a bit of a forever DM, as he is the one willing to organize and run the games, investing the time and effort to make them fun for everyone. His focus is on player involvement and fun, and the ruleset are used as guidance, and not an absolute. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond his gaming background, he is a writer/editor by trade – focused in the scientific and engineering fields, with some creative writing background. Hobbies besides gaming includes archery, fencing, swimming, boxing, Ren Faires, writing, and reading voraciously.
                    </p>

                <br/>
                <br/>
                 <i style = "margin-left:25px;"> Beside the warm glow of the hearth, a battle-worn cleric sits in quiet solitude, his polished armor catching the flicker of the fire. His shield bearing the symbol of his patron leans against the table, while a spiced mug of mead sits next to his book. He turns the page of his weathered tome, finding peace in the pages of history and the comfort of flame. </i>
                 <br/>
                <i style = "margin-left:25px;"> "That’s Brother Thane, once a war-cleric of the Dawnbringer Order — they say he called down divine fire on a battlefield so fierce it left the earth scorched for miles. He’s healed kings and felled monsters, now he travels with them. Dunno why he joined them, but he is now inseparable from them."</i>
                     <h2 class="mt-3">Wayne Miller</h2>
                    <p> 
                        Wayne is our go-to Texan and all-around utility player—whether it’s mastering PhotoShop, offering expert advice on design and layout, or overseeing production and purchasing. True to his Lone Star roots, he's also an avid football enthusiast. When he’s not juggling countless tasks to help drive the company forward, Wayne devotes most of his time to his wife and three kids. His downtime includes fishing, camping, and—more often than not—rushing from one kid-related activity to another, like chess club, choir, dance and tap lessons, baseball and football practices, or piano sessions. A nature lover at heart, Wayne makes the most of living on four country acres, where he enjoys tending the garden and firing up the grill.
                    </p>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                 <i style = "margin-left:25px;"> The tavern roared with laughter as the broad-shouldered warrior slammed a carved game piece onto the board, sending his opponent’s token toppling. Clad in chainmail and a battle-worn helm, the Northman bellows with pride, gripping his drink like a badge of honor. He shouts with joy, raising his mug high, demanding yet another drink and another challenger with a voice that thunders over the crackling hearth, eyes scanning the room for anyone bold enough to meet him across the game board. With a grin, he makes a rude remark towards the now red-faced opponent. </i>
                 <br/>
                <i style = "margin-left:25px;"> The tavern keep speaks again, "Ah, yeah the last of the group, and certainly not the least of them. That is Raginhild, a former Northman raider who killed a dragon just so he can have free drinks at this bar. His tab is in the hundreds of gold pieces... You can tell he loves to boast and prove that if he can, he will."</i>
                     <h2 class="mt-3">Adam Cox: Wargame-monger and Fish Ranger</h2>
                    <p> 
                        Adam is our web designer and the youngest member of the team. A lifelong gamer, he’s immersed himself in both tabletop and video games for as long as he can remember. Lately, he’s taken a deep dive into the world of wargaming and miniature painting. With experience in a wide range of games—both mainstream and niche—Adam brings fresh energy and a creative spark to everything he does. He's also drawn to the ocean, with a strong passion for diving. His educational path included commercial dive training, and today he puts that to use by feeding sharks and fish at a public aquarium. He’s currently expanding his scuba certifications with the goal of becoming a dive master—and possibly even an instructor. Adam has also picked up skills in welding, AutoCAD, and basic computer coding to round out his technical abilities. When he’s not underwater or working on web projects, you’ll likely find him at a tabletop with friends, gaming or painting miniatures—sometimes with great results, sometimes... less so, but always with enthusiasm.
